### Props

the above is use of the default objects  (Props)

below is the use of objects by destructuring (Desturcturing Props)

below is the use of default of properties of objects (Default Prop)

### ArraySlice

in this we used props again and created a joblisting component in file SingleJobList that has a property Job which is used in that and in the file Joblisting 

           {/* {jobs.map((job) => (
              <SingleJobList key={job.id} job={job} />
            ))} */}

this is how it is used
